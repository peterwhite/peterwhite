## Nice Things People Have Said
I've worked with some lovely people who have said some nice things about my work as a Developer and Product Owner.

> *Peter is a pro and a pleasure to work with. He's the type of technical go-to person every team needs, always with an eye on the business case. He's also very easy to speak too and really knows his stuff.*
>
> **Mike Leigh Cooper - Owner at InkBlot Films**

> *I had the pleasure of working with Peter on TABLE.co's new marketing website. He did a pixel-perfect job in taking it from design to code in what was a relatively tight timeframe. The website he delivered was fully responsive, fast-loading and even included some nice loading animations that we hadn't even considered at the design phase. Intelligent, enthusiastic and attentive to his clients, Peter is someone who does exactly what he says he's going to do and he does it very well*

> **Noel Lynagh - Founder at Table.co**

> *Peter has always given impeccable, prompt, well thought out support and feedback. In short, he is a rock-star!* 
>
> **Masad Baba - Attorney**

> *Peter really helped drive our Agile process on. His liaising withstakeholders and prioritisation of features were crucial to keeping the engineering team delivering things people actually wanted*

> **Patrick Cherry - Engineering Manager, speaking about my role as a Product Owner**
