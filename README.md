# Nice to meet you!

Happily building things on the internet since 2008.

Proud to be part of the engineering team at Graphy; giving everyone data superpowers.

Originally from Yorkshire in the UK, I have been living in Norway since 2021. Outside of technology, I spend my time learning Norwegian, walking in nature and listening to podcasts.
